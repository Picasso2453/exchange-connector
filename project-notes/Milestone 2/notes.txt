exchange connector

allow for multi threading:
An example clean policy is:
1 connection = 1 receive loop task (per exchange/market endpoint)
1 single writer task that prints to stdout (prevents interleaved JSON lines)
optional: parsing/processing can be inline in the receive loop, or posted to a queue
Use a single output queue (Channel<string> is ideal).
All receive loops push JSON lines to the channel.
One writer reads and writes to stdout.

Make it package-able into a DLL.
example structure:
Xws.Core (Class Library / DLL)
    WS client wrapper
    reconnect + backoff
    exchange adapters (HL/MEXC)
    message routing
    output formatting (raw/envelope)
    cancellation + lifecycle
    no Console.* calls inside core
xws (Console app)
    CLI parsing
    reads env vars
    wires up logging
    prints stdout/stderr
    calls Xws.Core
