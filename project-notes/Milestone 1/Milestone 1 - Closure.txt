Milestone 1 Closure ✅ (Project is now “shipped”)
What exists

xws .NET 8 CLI (Windows-primary, CI proves Ubuntu build)

Hyperliquid adapter with:

xws hl subscribe trades --symbol <native> → streams raw WS frames to stdout as JSONL

xws hl symbols [--filter ...] → discovery via /info, outputs raw JSONL

xws hl subscribe positions → private user/account stream gated by env vars, outputs raw JSONL

Strict IO contract

stdout = WS messages only (JSONL)

stderr = logs/status/errors

Robust reconnect

exponential backoff

auto re-subscribe

fail after 3 reconnect failures with non-zero exit + clear stderr error

Deterministic validation flags

--max-messages

--timeout-seconds

Clean shutdown

Ctrl+C → exit code 0

Infra

GitHub Actions CI: Windows + Ubuntu

README usage + dotnet publish instructions

DECISIONS.md reflects M1 decisions

Tagged release (e.g., v0.1.0) and pushed

What does NOT exist (intentionally)

No normalized schema / cross-exchange abstraction layer

No order placement, signing, or trading features

No local state tracking, persistence, DB/files

No TUI

No symbol translation (BTC/USDT mapping) — exchange-native only

Final locked scope confirmation

Milestone 1 scope is permanently frozen. Any additive work is a new milestone (change budget for M1 is now closed).
